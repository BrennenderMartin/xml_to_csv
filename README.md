# xml_to_csv
 This is my repository for the internship in Ireland, where i created a programm, that took information out of a xml-file and turned it into a csv-file

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

this command is to be used, to install all neccessary 
librarys for Python.

to create an  exe file use:
    pyinstaller main.py - on the work PC
    py -m PyInstaller main.py - on my Laptop
