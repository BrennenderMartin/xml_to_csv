# xml_to_csv
 This is my repository for the internship in Ireland, where i created a programm, that took information out of a xml-file and turned it into a csv-file

If you just want to download the programm and dont care about anything else, jsut download the xml_to_csv_exe_main.zip file, unpack it and then you can use it.

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

this command is to be used, to install all neccessary 
librarys for Python.

to create an  exe file use:
    pyinstaller main.py - on the work PC
    py -m PyInstaller main.py - on my Laptop
